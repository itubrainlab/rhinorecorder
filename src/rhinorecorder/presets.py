"""The Unicorn Recorder's predefined filters, notches and display ranges.

Every filter is an IIR filter in second-order sections, applied causally
to the EEG channels only. Bandpass, highpass and lowpass are 4th-order
Butterworth designs; each notch is a second-order IIR notch with a
quality factor of 30. A cascading notch removes the line frequency and
every harmonic of it below the Nyquist frequency.
