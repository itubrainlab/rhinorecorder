"""Signal quality per electrode, as the signal quality scope shows it.

Like Unicorn Recorder's, it filters the raw EEG to the band where EEG
lives and judges each electrode by how much the filtered signal varies:
an electrode is good while the variation stays in the range EEG has.
Too little means a flat or saturated channel, too much means a loose
electrode, movement or mains pickup. The filters need time to settle, so
no judgement is made during the first seconds.

The band alone is fooled by an electrode that touches no skin: its input
floats, and the raw signal drifts by tens of millivolts a second, all of
it far below the band, so what is left after filtering looks like quiet
EEG. Two things give it away. An electrode in contact holds a steady
offset, so a channel whose raw signal swings by more than
``RAW_SWING_LIMIT_UV`` within the window is bad. And a floating input
picks up only what is common to all of them, so a channel whose filtered
signal follows the average of the others almost exactly (correlation
above ``COMMON_MODE_LIMIT``) is bad too.

Measured on a Unicorn Hybrid Black (UN-2024.10.18), in 2 s windows:
